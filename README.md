This repository contains the data and the scripts used in the manuscript "Hubness reduction improves downstream analyses of single-cell transcriptomic data" in which we study the hubness phenomenon and related observations in single-cell RNA sequencing data.


Aims
-----------
1. Evaluate hubs in sequencing data

(1a) Measuring hubness & define hubs

(1b) Study the nature of hubs & antihubs

(1c) Understand the parameters influencing hubness

2. Take advantage of hubs to improve the analysis

(2a) Clustering

(2b) Trajectory Inference

(2c) Visualisation


Scripts
-----------
All scripts used to produced the figures in the manuscript are available in this repository and are organized by experiment and by language (either R or python).


 Data
-----------
We used public datasets and regrouped them in a Zenodo repository [here](https://zenodo.org/deposit?page=1&size=20).

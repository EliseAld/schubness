Hubness on single-cell RNA sequencing data

Steps
-----------
1. Do we have hubs in scRNAseq ?

(1a) Measuring hubness in sequencing data & define hubs

(1b) Are hubs & antihubs different ?

(1c) Is hubness sensitive to dropout ?

2. Can we use hubs to enhance the single-cell analysis ?

(2a) Clustering

(2b) TI

(2c) Visualisation
